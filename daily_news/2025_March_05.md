[Study Notes 5.6.3-4 Setting up a Dataproc Cluster & Connecting Spark to BigQuery](https://dev.to/pizofreude/study-notes-563-4-setting-up-a-dataproc-cluster-connecting-spark-to-big-query-2pef)
*   GCloud Dataproc simplifies running Spark and Hadoop workloads on GCP with managed infrastructure and seamless integration with other GCP services like GCS and BigQuery.
*   The BigQuery connector enables Spark to directly read from and write to BigQuery tables, bypassing the need for intermediate storage in GCS.

[Study Notes 5.6.1-2 Spark on cloud & local](https://dev.to/pizofreude/study-notes-561-2-spark-on-cloud-local-2mnc)
*   Connecting Spark to Google Cloud Storage involves uploading data to GCS, downloading the GCS connector JAR, and configuring Spark with the necessary settings and credentials.
*   Creating a local Spark cluster involves converting Jupyter notebooks into Python scripts, starting and managing Spark cluster components, and using spark-submit for configuration.

[Study Notes 5.5.1-2 Operations on Spark RDDs & Spark RDD mapPartition](https://dev.to/pizofreude/study-notes-551-2-operations-on-spark-rdds-spark-rdd-mappartition-337k)
*   RDDs are the low-level, core abstraction in Apache Spark for working with distributed data, and understanding them is crucial for grasping Sparkâ€™s internals and optimizing performance.
*   `mapPartitions` is a transformation that applies a function to each entire partition, useful for initializing expensive resources or processing large datasets in chunks.

[Study Notes 5.4.1-3 Anatomy of a Spark Cluster GroupBy & Joins in Spark](https://dev.to/pizofreude/study-notes-541-3-anatomy-of-a-spark-cluster-groupby-joins-in-spark-4loj)
*   A Spark cluster comprises the driver, Spark Master, and executors, with jobs divided into tasks distributed among executors, ensuring fault tolerance through task reassignment.
*   GroupBy operations in Spark involve local aggregation per partition and shuffling to collate data, while joins use sort merge or broadcast strategies depending on dataset sizes.

[Study Notes 5.3.3-4 Data Processing & SQL with Spark](https://dev.to/pizofreude/study-notes-533-4-data-processing-sql-with-spark-4ljm)
*   Preparing data for Spark involves automating data downloads, organizing files, defining schemas, and converting CSV to Parquet for efficient storage and querying.
*   Spark SQL can be used to process and query data, harmonize datasets, and write results back to disk, integrating seamlessly with data lakes.

[Study Notes 5.3.1-2 First Look at Spark/PySpark & Spark Dataframes](https://dev.to/pizofreude/study-notes-531-2-first-look-at-sparkpyspark-spark-dataframes-3od4)
*   PySpark allows reading CSV files, defining schemas, converting between Pandas and Spark DataFrames, and partitioning data for parallel processing.
*   Spark DataFrames offer a flexible way to process large-scale data with lazy evaluation and built-in SQL functions.

[Study Notes 5.1.1-2 Introduction to Batch Processing & spark](https://dev.to/pizofreude/study-notes-511-2-introduction-to-batch-processing-spark-glb)
*   Batch processing is a method of processing data in large chunks at scheduled intervals, ideal for large-scale ETL, reporting, and machine learning model training.
*   Apache Spark is a powerful tool for batch processing, utilizing DataFrames and SQL for structured data manipulation and providing scalable deployment options on cloud platforms.
