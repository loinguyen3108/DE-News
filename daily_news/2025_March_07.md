## Summary content
Today's data engineering updates cover diverse topics, starting with an individual's experience using Apache Spark for batch processing NYC taxi data, analyzing over 125K trips. Then, a tutorial on efficiently moving data from Oracle to Elasticsearch using BladePipe for real-time search is presented, focusing on Change Data Capture (CDC) for low-latency data replication. Lastly, a solution for converting a non-standard table with an uncertain number of paired fields from columns to rows is demonstrated, comparing SQL and SPL (esProc SPL) code, highlighting SPL's simplicity and flexibility in handling dynamic column names.
